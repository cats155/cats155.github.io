# Images folder

Place image files (jpg, png, webp, etc.) into this folder to serve them from the static site. After adding files, update `images/images.json` with the filenames.

Example `images/images.json` for local files:

```
[
  "photo1.jpg",
  "photo2.png"
]
```

You can also include full URLs instead of filenames to show externally hosted images.
